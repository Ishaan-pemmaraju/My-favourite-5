    <p> Mr. Elon Musk, you play a huge role life as my inspiration. My family has a Tesla Model X. I love how you work and look too. You are capable of many things and you have used them all to create and impress people like me. You have taken cars to the next level and didn't stop there. Also maybe in your next car you can put TV's in the back row so that it does'nt distract the driver and you should keep the sound controlled so that only the person who is sitting there can only hear. </p>
